67482, I also have made a purchase yesterday which I have emailed about in which I was charged for next day delivery which I DID NOT select and never got a chance to review the payment before I paid and confirmed the order,,67481
67483, I have £173.94 of pending transactions currently waiting to be paid to amazon. I have only ordered about £127 of stuff and I was told the transactions would clear and the extra payments would be cancelled when I received the order. I sent two emails regarding this and got 1 back.,67485,67481
67485," Hi, can you please tell us what you were advised in your email? ^HS",67486,67483
67486, The only email I have received said that the money that was ‘pending’ would be taken out or would be cancelled when I received my order but it hasn’t so I still have almost £200 pending and don’t know if the payments are coming or going over a week after I got the first delivery,67487,67485
67487, I am sorry to hear this Lois. Can you please contact us through the following link so we can investigate this for you and we will also look to see can we change the delivery method for you: https://t.co/JzP7hlA23B.^GA,67488,67486
67488," I have done and it is the 3rd email I have sent in the last 2 days, is there a way you can ensure I get a reply please as I still haven’t had one since I first queried the payment issues last week?",67489,67487
67489, We wouldn't have access from here for security reasons to check for an update on this. I would suggest the phone or chat option for immediate response on this for you and to avoid any further back and forth. You can use this link: https://t.co/JzP7hlA23B Thanks ^NV,,67488

67490, Have you been able to add delivery or safe-place instructions on your orders?^PJ,67491,67492
67491," I do not know what you mean - shouldn't the parcel be delivered in person if too big to fit in the post box and if the person is not available then a note should be left to tell when it would be delivered next, that show it works, doesn't it?","6,749,367,494",67490
67493, And a few other parcels for other people were left unattended too in a place that anyone could've taken them. Not a safe place at all.,67495,67491

67504, I did report the latest delivery and it seems like it happens a lot as there is a feature for this to complain in place. I also did for the previous delivery and because the box was open then I returned the item.,67505,67503

67512, requested for a replacement of an order after I received the used item. Instead I was asked to send the item to given address even though I've asked for alternate pickup address. Item being a power bank cannot be sent through post.,67510,
